# Image Upload & Display Fix - Backup Documentation

## Overview
This document details the fixes implemented for image upload and display issues in the Matt Dinh Blog project.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Image Upload Not Working in Blog Posts
**Problem**: Images uploaded via the rich text editor appeared in the editor preview but did not show up on the public blog page.

**Root Cause**: 
- Images were uploaded to Supabase storage successfully
- Content stored in database was not updated with new image URLs
- Markdown content contained image syntax but wasn't being rendered as HTML

**Solution**:
- Updated `RichTextEditor.tsx` to convert uploaded images to JPG format
- Added image processing before upload (resize to 800px width)
- Implemented proper content update with new image URLs

### 2. Hydration Errors in Next.js
**Problem**: Server/client HTML mismatch causing hydration errors.

**Root Cause**: 
- Using `marked` library for Markdown to HTML conversion on client side
- Server and client rendering different HTML content

**Solution**:
- Removed `marked` library from client-side rendering
- Implemented simple regex-based Markdown image conversion
- Ensured consistent rendering between server and client

### 3. Build Errors
**Problem**: TypeScript errors and missing components preventing successful builds.

**Root Cause**:
- Missing `CategoryArticleListClient` component
- Next.js 15 compatibility issues with params types
- Incorrect Promise handling for searchParams

**Solution**:
- Created missing `CategoryArticleListClient.tsx` component
- Updated params types to use `Promise<{...}>` for Next.js 15
- Fixed searchParams handling with proper await

   - Created missing component for category pages
   - Implements client-side data fetching
   - Handles loading states and error handling

### TypeScript Fixes
7. **`src/app/[lang]/blog/category/[slug]/page.tsx`**
   - Fixed params type for Next.js 15 compatibility
   - Added proper Promise handling

8. **`src/app/tag/[slug]/page.tsx`**
   - Fixed searchParams Promise handling
   - Added proper await for params resolution

## Technical Implementation Details

### Image Processing Workflow
```typescript
// 1. Upload image to temporary location
// 2. Process image (resize, convert to JPG)
// 3. Upload processed image to Supabase storage
// 4. Update content with new image URL in Markdown format
// 5. Save updated content to database
```

### Markdown to HTML Conversion
```typescript
// Simple regex to convert Markdown images to HTML
const convertMarkdownImagesToHtml = (content: string) => {
  return content.replace(/!\[([^\]]*)\]\(([^)]+)\)/g, '<img src="$2" alt="$1" class="max-w-full h-auto rounded-lg shadow-md" />');
};
```

### Hydration-Safe Rendering
- Server: Pass raw Markdown content
- Client: Convert Markdown images to HTML using regex
- No external libraries that could cause mismatches

## Testing Results

### Before Fixes
- ❌ Images not displaying on blog pages
- ❌ Hydration errors in browser console
- ❌ Build failures due to TypeScript errors
- ❌ Missing components causing runtime errors

### After Fixes
- ✅ Images display correctly on blog pages
- ✅ No hydration errors
- ✅ Successful builds with no TypeScript errors
- ✅ All components properly implemented
- ✅ Image upload and processing working correctly

## Performance Improvements

1. **Image Optimization**
   - Automatic resizing to 800px width
   - JPG format conversion for better compression
   - Reduced file sizes while maintaining quality

2. **Build Optimization**
   - Removed unnecessary dependencies (`marked`)
   - Fixed TypeScript errors for faster compilation
   - Optimized component imports

3. **Runtime Performance**
   - Client-side image conversion using lightweight regex
   - No external library overhead for Markdown processing
   - Efficient content rendering

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables Required
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

### Supabase Storage Permissions
Ensure the following storage policies are in place:
- Public read access for blog images
- Authenticated write access for image uploads
- Proper bucket configuration for image storage

### Build Commands
```bash
npm run build  # Successful build confirmed
npm run dev    # Development server
```

## Future Considerations

1. **Image Optimization**
   - Consider implementing WebP format for better compression
   - Add lazy loading for images
   - Implement responsive images with multiple sizes

2. **Content Management**
   - Add image alt text management
   - Implement image gallery functionality
   - Add image metadata storage

3. **Performance**
   - Consider CDN integration for image delivery
   - Implement image caching strategies
   - Add image compression optimization

## Conclusion

The image upload and display issues have been successfully resolved. The blog now supports:
- Reliable image uploads through the rich text editor
- Proper image display on public blog pages
- No hydration errors or build issues
- Optimized image processing and storage

The solution maintains simplicity while providing robust functionality for content creators.

## Unsaved Changes Navigation Guard (Admin Blog Edit & Create Forms)

**Date:** 2024-07-19

### What was fixed

- Added a robust, reusable navigation guard for all admin blog forms (edit and create) to prevent accidental data loss.
- Now, if you have unsaved changes and try to navigate away (via breadcrumbs, navigation bar, sidebar, any `<a>` or `<Link>`, or router navigation), a confirmation popup will appear.
- This works for:
  - Breadcrumbs (now use a navigation guard prop)
  - Navigation bar/sidebar links
  - All in-app navigation (Next.js router, `<Link>`, `<a>`, etc.)
  - Browser tab close/refresh (native popup)

### How it works

- Implemented a reusable React hook: `useUnsavedChangesWarning(hasUnsavedChanges)`
  - Listens for all navigation events and shows a `window.confirm` popup if there are unsaved changes.
  - Can be used in any admin form for future-proofing.
- Updated the `Breadcrumbs` component to accept an `onNavigate` prop, so parent forms can inject a navigation guard.
- The solution is robust to refactoring and new navigation components.
- **This is now applied to both the blog edit and create forms.**

### How to use in other forms

- Import and call `useUnsavedChangesWarning(hasUnsavedChanges)` in any form component.
- Pass `onNavigate={handleBreadcrumbNavigate}` to `Breadcrumbs` if you want explicit control.

**This ensures you will never lose unsaved work in the admin panel due to accidental navigation.**
