## Admin Blog Forms - Unsaved Changes Protection

- The admin blog edit and create forms must protect users from losing unsaved changes.
- If a user has unsaved changes and tries to navigate away (via breadcrumbs, navigation bar, sidebar, any `<a>` or `<Link>`, or router navigation), a confirmation popup must appear.
- This is implemented via a reusable React hook and a navigation guard prop on the Breadcrumbs component.
- This protection is now applied to both the blog edit and create forms.
